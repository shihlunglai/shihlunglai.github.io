## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **federated learning**, **machine learning**, and **generative models**â€”particularly diffusion-based augmentation under non-IID data settings and privacy-preserving learning systems.

## Works in Progress

- **Federated Diffusion with Non-IID Partitioning**  
  Investigating how class-conditional diffusion models can improve local performance in federated setups, particularly under Dirichlet-based data heterogeneity.

- **Differential Privacy in Diffusion-Based Generation**  
  A comparative study of injecting DP noise during different phases of the diffusion process (forward vs. reverse) and analyzing its impact on downstream learning tasks.

## Coming Soon

I am currently preparing manuscripts based on experimental results. Updates will be posted here once submitted or accepted.
