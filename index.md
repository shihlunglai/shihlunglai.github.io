## About Me

I am a graduate student at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST), conducting research in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

My research interests include:
- Machine Learning
- Federated Learning
- Non-IID data distributions
- Diffusion models for data augmentation
- Privacy-preserving machine learning (e.g., Differential Privacy)

Currently, I focus on enhancing the performance and fairness of federated learning systems under data heterogeneity. In particular, I am exploring the integration of diffusion models into federated learning frameworks to improve data representation and personalization.

If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, feel free to contact me at [janchen0716@gmail.com](mailto:janchen0716@gmail.com).
