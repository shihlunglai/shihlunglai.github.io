## Current Projects

### Federated Diffusion for Non-IID Data Augmentation
Exploring the integration of diffusion models within federated learning to generate class-conditional data, improving model generalization under non-IID distributions. This includes:
- Conditional data generation using reverse diffusion
- Personalized model fine-tuning
- DP noise injection during diffusion stages

### Differential Privacy in Generative Models
Investigating how differentially private noise affects the fidelity of generated data and its downstream usability in federated settings. Key focuses include:
- Comparing DP noise on forward vs. reverse diffusion
- Measuring accuracy, FID, and Inception Score impact
